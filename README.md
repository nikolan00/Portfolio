# ML-portfolio

In this repository, I present my past work in the area of machine learning.
Currently it includes:
- [3D_Multi_Modal_DL](3D_Multi_Modal_DL) \
  This project is my Master Thesis. It aims to increase the performance of a vision-based 6D pose estimation approach by incorporating 3D data. Specifically, the first step of pose estimation, namely instance segmentation / object detection was targeted in my work. My contribution includes training a modified instance of the [Rotation-Invariant Transformer for Point Cloud Matching](https://github.com/haoyu94/RoITr) on a self-generated synthetic dataset and incorporating it into the pipeline of the [SAM-6D instance segmentation model](https://github.com/JiehongLin/SAM-6D/tree/main/SAM-6D/Instance_Segmentation_Model). This enabled stronger results on pose estimation for textureless objects.
- [3D Object detection and Captioning](3D_Object_detection_and_Captioning) \
  This project was part of my Master's degree - It focused on implementing and training a Transformer from scratch to detect objects in a room and describe their appearance and position in natural language. The result is a competitive performance on indoor scene segmentation.
- [DDQN for Connect 4](DDQN_Connect_4) \
  Here, you can find my implementation of the _Double Deep Q-Network_ for the game Connect-4. Training the model for two million episodes, a strong human-level performance was reached.
- [DL from Scratch](DL_From_Scratch) \
  In this project I implemented a Deep Learning architecture solely based on NumPy, deepening my understanding of neural networks.
- [Basic ML Models](ML_Basic_Models) \
  This folder covers several basic ML approaches that I implemented to strengthen my ML fundamentals.
